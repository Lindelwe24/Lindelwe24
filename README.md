### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
 ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a Random Playlist Generator App that can randomly generate a list of songs for your playlist. It considers your liked songs , the year , genre etc and creates a playlist based on those parameters.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript and Python.
